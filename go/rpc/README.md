# RPC simple example

After reading the excellent write-up by Kelsey Hightower in Login Usenix magazine, Spring 2016. I decied to make this similar 
example for running a "remote cat".

```
$ cd server && go build -o servercat
$ cd client  && go build -o rcat
```

Then run both of them separatelly a

```
$ ./rcat  -f /etc/resolv.conf                                       
RPC dialing..                                                                             
RPC call...
